## Test Oracle

A Test Oracle is a concept used in software testing. 

It refers to an external reference or resource 
that provides expected results or behavior to help 
testers verify the correctness of software.

## Test Prioritization

Test Prioritization is a software testing strategy used to determine the execution order 
and importance of test cases. 

Its goal is to optimize the testing process by prioritizing important test cases to be executed first, 

in order to detect defects or issues more quickly.

## Test plan

* Analyze the product
* Design test strategy
  * testing scope
  * testing type (unit/feature/system...)
  * risk and issue might face
  * test logistics
    * who testing
    * when testing
    * testing what
* define tes objective
  * performance/correction/view/system...
* test criteria
  * how to know the test is pass or fail
* resource planning
  * what you need for the testing
* plan test environment
* schedule and estimate
* test deliverables - what to delivery when
    * before testing
    * during testing
    * after testing

## Test case

* StepUp
  * preparation for the test
* Test description
