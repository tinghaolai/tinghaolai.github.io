## Why multithreading is not necessary for api server


Multithreading is not suitable for writing servers. 
Multithreading is an excessive technology that

### Why? 

Because of containerization and clustering.

How to utilize the performance of a server is no longer the concern of the server itself.

Instead, it is the concern of containers and clusters.
