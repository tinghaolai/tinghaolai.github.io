## Passionate

When friends ask me what's the key to be a engineer, 

I always say "passion".

## But why

You can't be happy with your job without passion.

You won't improve yourself, learning new technology without passion.

## What's passion anyway

I always think I have passion about coding,

but one day I realize that I might don't have the passion.

Besides always doing the same works every day,

I'm still happy what Im doing.

I think I'm only a `love-coding` guy,

but I don't have the passion about other things.

## My passion journey

To be honest, 

why I study about these tech's main reason is to get a better job,

get a better salary.

But in the process of learning,

I might found my `passion`.

I really like a saying from my former boss: 

> Engineers are meant to do some cool stuff.

And this reminds me why I want and like to be an engineer.

Because it's cool, 

that's it.

And many thing can be cool,

but also improve yourself, improve the team.

* How to write a better code
  * For maintainability
  * For performance
* Know the base/advanced knowledge
  * For solving problem
  * For building better product
* Learn new technology
  * For working flow better
  * For your team better

All these things can be a cool thing,

and once you start think like this,

your daily work will totally change,

discuss with your team,

find a better solution,

build a better product.

solving problems,

And not just do the same thing every day.
