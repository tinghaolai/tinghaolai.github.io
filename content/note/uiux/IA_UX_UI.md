## IA, UX and UI

That's say if there's one page,

I want to have these features: 

* Add exercise record 
* Show exercise record

Here's the step to design the page:

1. IA - check the spec
   * what to add to exercise record, can user specify the date? and what to show in the record list?
2. UX - how does it display?
   * where the exercise form should be?
   * how we show the record list? lazy load or pagination?
   * what happen if user click the record list item?
3. UI - how does it look like?
   * what's the color?
   * what's the font?
   * what's the icon?
   * what's the layout?
