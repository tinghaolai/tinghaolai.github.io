## Connect ssh to VM

It should be not worth to be note..., but still I stuck this problem over an hour, cuz I didn't read the example carefully.

Click left bar `Settings`->`Metadata`, and click `Edit`, `SSH keys` and add public key, and what making me stuck is the private key schema, user info should be your email address, or it could cause error.
