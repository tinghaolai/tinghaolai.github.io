## Workout app - backend

About one year ago I started to workout,

I want to record my workout progress and other records about training,

but I can't find a good app to achieve all my requirement,

so I invite my colleague to join me to build this app,

but we're still working on it.

## Golang migration

When we start build our workout project above,

we tried some migration tools in golang,

but all of them seems not so convenient as Laravel migration,

so we decide to build our own migration lib.

## Workout app - frontend

After trying `vue`, `react`, `angular`,

So far,

I really think flutter is more fun, easy-develop, easy-maintain to build the appearance.

everyone who like to build their own tools must try it.

## Punch check

My current company is using `nueip` to check our punch time,

but sometimes you will forget to punch,

so I build this chrome extension to help me check my punch time.
